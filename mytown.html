        <h4 id="list-item-2">History</h4>
        <p>Aleppo is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world; it may have been inhabited since the sixth millennium BC. Excavations at Tell as-Sawda and Tell al-Ansari,
           just south of the old city of Aleppo, show that the area was occupied by Amorites by the latter part of the third millennium BC.
            That is also the time at which Aleppo is first mentioned in cuneiform tablets unearthed in Ebla and Mesopotamia, which speak of it as part of the Amorite state of Yamhad, and note its commercial and military importance.
            Such a long history is attributed to its strategic location as a trading center between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia.

          For centuries, Aleppo was the largest city in the Syrian region, and the Ottoman Empire's third-largest after Istanbul and Cairo.
           The city's significance in history has been its location at one end of the Silk Road, which passed through Central Asia and Mesopotamia.
           When the Suez Canal was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline.
            At the fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern Turkey, as well as the important Baghdad Railway connecting it to Mosul. In the 1940s it lost its main access to the sea, by Antakya and İskenderun, also to Turkey.
             The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage.
              It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks.</p>
        <h4 id="list-item-3">Geography</h4>
        <p>Aleppo lies about 120 km (75 mi) inland from the Mediterranean Sea,
           on a plateau 380 m (1,250 ft) above sea level, 45 km (28 mi) east of the Syrian-Turkish border checkpoint of Bab al-Hawa.
            The city is surrounded by farmlands from the north and the west, widely cultivated with olive and pistachio trees.
             To the east, Aleppo approaches the dry areas of the Syrian Desert.


          Queiq River
          The city was founded a few kilometres south of the location of the current old city,
           on the right bank of Queiq River which arises from the Aintab plateau in the north and runs through Aleppo southward to the fertile country of Qinnasrin.
            The old city of Aleppo lies on the left bank of the Queiq. It was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected. The radius of the circle is about 10 km (6.2 mi).
             The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta. The old city was enclosed within an ancient wall that was last rebuilt by the Mamluks.
              The wall has since disappeared. It had nine gates and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.
          
          Occupying an area of more than 190 km2 (73 sq mi), Aleppo is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Middle East.
           According to the new major plan of the city adopted in 2001, it is envisaged to increase the total area of Aleppo up to 420 km2 (160 sq mi) by the end of 2015.</p>
